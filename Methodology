Problem: Laying fiber cable across town 
Solution: 
1. creates a graph with nodes as area cabinets.
2.create weighted edges as paths from one node to another. 
3.select paths to Connect the base with each node.

Time complexity: O(nlog(n))

Implimentation Steps:
Step1: Enter choice
Step 2:Load database

Step 3:Display
Step 4:Edges/nodes

Step 5:Add edge/node

Step 6:calculate and display MST

Step 7:Continue?


1. most applications simulating maps use weighted graphs.
Eg: Google maps

Whats unique in our project?
1.open source

2.minimalist

3.easy to implement and use

4.Easier for small scale networks

5. Complete object oriented(no global variables or public).

6. Efficient (no nested for loops).

7. Realtime database (can edit from both program and database).
