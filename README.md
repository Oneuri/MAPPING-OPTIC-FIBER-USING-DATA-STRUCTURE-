MAPPING FIBER OPTIC Network USING DATA STRUCTURE Algorithm (Kruskal's Algorithm)


ABSTRACT: 
Fiber optics, or optical fiber, refers to the medium and the technology associated with the transmission of information as light pulses along a glass or plastic strand or fiber. 
Fiber cables offer several advantages over traditional long- distance copper cabling. 
Fiber optics have a higher capacity. The amount of network bandwidth a fiber cable can carry easily exceeds that of a copper cable with similar thickness. Fiber cables rated at 10 Gbps, 40 Gbps, and even 100 Gbps are standard. 
Nowadays the use of fiber optics has increased because of the high speeds it offers. 
In order to establish a fiber optic network an underground network of tunnels is essential. Through this project FTTC (Fiber To The Cabinet) is being established at locations according to the data obtained by a survey. In order to maintain a network ; frequent adding, deleting, updating of nodes need to be carried out. The most optimal method for performing these functions is by using tree data structure. In addition to that the QT GUI library for C++ will provide various functions to develop a user friendly graphic interface.



It is an application which determines the minimum path to be followed by ﬁber optics between two stations! It is based on Kruskal's algorithm in data structure to analyse Nodes as well as to ﬁnd MST!
